    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

    # Install the required packages
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Create a `.env` file:**
    In the root of your project folder, create a new file named `.env` and add your Google API key:
    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
